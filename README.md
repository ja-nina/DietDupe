DietDupe: The flavourful Feat of Finding Fantastic Food Facsimiles

## Initial Plan

### Overall

By leveraging FlavorGraph, we can identify suitable substitutes for various
dietary preferences, such as vegan, keto, and low-carb, while maintaining
sensory satisfaction, ultimately enhancing the adherence and satisfaction of
individuals following these diets.

By using the output of our DD module we could inject it into the reverse-cooking
pipeline and make it produce sensible recipes.

### Steps

1. Research
2. Finding a database of food categories(example: vegan, paleo, keto, low carb,
   etc.) -  USDA Database
3. Provide a mapping to FlavourGraph - evaluation can be seen in [matching_evaluation.py](notebooks\matching_evaluation.ipynb), development summarised in [hierarchical_matching.ipynb](notebooks\hierarchical_matching.ipynb)
4a. EXPERIMENT with Matching approaches ( matching approatches settled on ensemble embedder, a mix of embedding from food2vec(library allows for only ~100 matchings) and Domain-Addapted Bert.
4b. EXPERIMENT with retriever approaches, isolated retriever, #TODOD: context retriever, tahing recipe into account.
5. Pick best approach 

### Literature

- FlavourGraph <https://github.com/lamypark/FlavorGraph>
- inverse cooking <https://github.com/facebookresearch/inversecooking>
- Bert
- FoodBert
- Food2Vec

### Datasets

- FoodDB (see in data folder - used description for possibble finetuning),
- FlavourGraph,
- dataset of food classification by food category (or nutriscore)
- [USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, Release 27](http://www.ars.usda.gov/ba/bhnrc/ndl), abbreviations will be used from [abbreviations APPENDIX A](https://data.nal.usda.gov/dataset/composition-foods-raw-processed-prepared-usda-national-nutrient-database-standard-referen-14)
- Recipe1M (to be tried)

### Future work
- Train flavourgraph or provide a better alternative (right now working with tsne-projections. Only the hub-node embeddings are usable, others really do not make sense
